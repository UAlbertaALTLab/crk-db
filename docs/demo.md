# Database Overview

## Motivation

* Arok's database is a living database. We needed a way to ingest that data without having to manually reannotate or remap those entries every time.
* We'd like to include additional data sources as well (e.g. AECD, Lacombe). We need a general import process/pipeline.

## What's Been Done

* Combined CW and MD dictionaries into a single database.
  - The aggregated database is in JSON.
  - The structure of the JSON data adheres to [DaFoDiL][DaFoDiL] (the Data Format for Digital Linguistics).
    - Potential interoperability with other DaFoDiL data sources in the future:
      - Monica Macaulay & Hunter Lockwood's Algonquian Components project
      - general DLx tools

## The Process

1. convert each individual data source to JSON
  * This also involves a lot of cleaning of the original data.
    - Extract literal definitions.
    - Extract cross-references.
    - Extract other notes/parentheticals.
2. import each data source into the ALTLab database
  * To start, the ALTLab database had 0 entries.
  * In theory, this process is commutative - the individual data sources can be imported in any order. (Still a work in progress.)
  * For each entry in the individual data source, I try to match it to a main entry using various pieces of information.
  * First, transcriptions and definitions are normalized:
    - transcriptions are quite literally NFC normalized
    - transcriptions are transliterated to SRO without <ý> or <ń>
    - definitions are normalized for the purpose of comparison (the underlying data is not changed)
      - MD: He sees him = CW: s/he sees s.o.
  * If a match is found, the current entry is saved as a subentry on the main entry.
  * If no match is found, a new main entry is made, with the current entry as the subentry.
3. aggregate the subentries into a single canonical main entry
  * This script looks at whatever subentries are available, and decides on what the main ALTLab entry should look like
    - what definitions should be included
    - what the transcription should be
    - what the POS should be

## Structure of the Database

* main entry: aggregated from individual data sources; this is the canonical ALTLab entry
  - lemma (in multiple orthographies)
  - senses: aggregated from individual data sources, without extraneous (repetitive) definitions
  - subentries: the original data/transcriptions/definitions, for reference (will not appear in itwêwina)
  - FST stem (sometimes different from the lemma)
  - unique key, with homograph numbers

## Converting _Cree: Words_ Toolbox Entries > DLx JSON

* Simple conversion - no matching/aggregating yet.
* Stored as NDJSON files.

## Converting Maskwacîs Dictionary to DLx JSON

* Simple conversion to JSON.
* Add MD > CW mappings.

### MD > CW Mappings

* Some CW entries have been updated, and can no longer be matched.
* Mappings file doesn't include POS, but this is a necessary disambiguator.
* Multiple mappings can point to the same CW entry. These MD entries get merged.
* I'd really like to move mappings directly into the MD database. Would make it much easier to a) compile the database, and b) update the MD data/mappings.

## Matching + Aggregating Individual Sources into the ALTLab Database

Caveat: This data structure can be adjusted if needed to accommodate our current data structure in itwêwina.

### _acâhkos_ 'star'

## Next Steps (for Parity with itwêwina)

- [ ] process POS information from individual data sources and standardize it on a canonical set of POS + inflectional classes
- [ ] import into itwêwina, adjusting ALTLab database entries if needed (potential pain point: multiple senses)
