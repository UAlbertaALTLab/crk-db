# Kate Schmirler's MD > CW Mappings

* These annotations are solely focused on a unidirectional mapping from MD > CW/ (Can this MD entry be mapped to a certain CW entry?)
* `conj`: One word is an inflected form of another.
* If the CW definition is different from the way it was when Katie did the coding, still parse the data, but mark it as needing checking.
* There are some cases of inflected imperatives (maybe others?) where Katie matched them to a lemma, but instead we want to generate a lemma for the inflected form too. We can mark these as our technical additions. Maybe down the road we could auto-generate a cross-reference between the imperative and lemma form.
* Right now itwewina only shows the MD entries that we were able to map. Only 5k out of 9k were included.
